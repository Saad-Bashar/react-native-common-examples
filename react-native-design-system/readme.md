### React Native Minimal Design System

Most of the times before starting a project we need to start with a basic design system boilerplate. Usually we need to setup colors, typography, spacing and other basic stuff. This example aims to provide a minimal design system boilerplate for React Native projects.

Given the following image of a design system we are going to create a boilerplate for it.

Tools that we are going to use:

1. [Nativewind(Tailwind for react native)](https://www.nativewind.dev/) - For setting up the design system and styling
2. [Storybook for react native](https://github.com/storybookjs/react-native) - For component development and demonstration
